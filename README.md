To run the training script “train_model.py,” the descriptors have to be generated by “pdb_input_processing.py” first.
If you are using your own descriptor, just make sure the X and y files have “_CI_X.npy” and “_CI_y.npy” suffixes.
Also include the descriptors for yes cases as “xxx_CI_X_yes.npy” and “xxx_CI_y_yes.npy,” so the script can evaluate water prediction accuracies.

python train_model.py -h will print help information on inputs.
-t train_pdb: pdb structure to be trained on. This is required
-p test_percentage: percent of input data used for validation. Default is 20%.
-v validate_pdb: pdb structure to be tested on, or the prediction pdb. This is optional.
-o output_filename: keras file for the model
